                    reasons to return the purchase or get a refund:</h2>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 30px; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>The Customer is unsatisfied with the product and 30 calendar days have not yet passed after the
                        delivery;</li>

                <h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: var(--text-black); margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Return
                    process and terms to return the product and be eligible for a refund:</h2>
                <p>In order to be eligible for a refund, the customer has to contact the Company via email address
                    provided <a href="#contact" style="color: var(--primary-blue); font-weight: 700;">here</a> and
                    return the product within 30 days after the delivery. Returns are time-sensitive, therefore if more
                    than 30 calendar days have passed after the delivery, the Company will not offer the Customer a
                    refund or price equivalent in-store credit.</p>
                <p>The customer must provide us with some photos of the product and explain why they want to return it.
                </p>
                <p>All products must be in the same brand-new state and in the original packaging. In case of damaged
                    products, we require the products to be returned in original and unused condition.</p>
                <p>The product must be sent to the return address provided by the Customer Support team within 30 days
                    after the delivery. The customer must provide us with a copy of the shipping receipt with the
                    tracking number. If the product is returned to a different address than the one that was indicated
                    by the Customer Support team, the customer won’t be eligible for a refund.</p>
                <p>It takes 5-7 business days to issue a refund after the purchase is returned to our Returns Center,
                    and 3-20 business days for the refund to appear in your bank account (depending on the payment
                    method).</p>
                <p>All shipping costs regarding returns, refunds, and or exchanges are the sole responsibility of the
                    customer.</p>
                <p>The Company does not provide pre-paid return shipping labels. The customer will be responsible for
                    paying for their own shipping costs for returning the item. Shipping costs are non-refundable.</p>
                <p>Depending on where the Customer lives, the time it may take for returned or exchanged product to
                    reach you may vary.</p>
                <p>The Company will not take any responsibility for any lost or damaged goods that are being returned.
                    Therefore, for any product valued over $15, the Customer should consider using a trackable shipping
                    service or purchasing shipping insurance.</p>
                <p>It is totally the responsibility of the Customer to return the product to the Returns Center
                    indicated by the Customer Support team. The Company cannot guarantee that the way the Customer chose
                    to return the item will ensure the item to be received.</p>
                <p>The product must be sent to the return address provided by the Customer Support team within 30 days
                    after the delivery. The customer must follow the return process in order to be eligible for a
                    refund.</p>
                <p>Items returned to the Company that are not eligible for a refund or store credit will be discarded or
                    sent back to you at your own expense.</p>
                <p>In the case of broken products, we will arrange a replacement to be shipped to you once the photos
                    will be reviewed and approved.</p>
                <p>The Company provides a refund to the Customer’s original payment method for all full-priced items.
                    There is no refund/reimbursement/replacement for outlet goods or reduced priced goods.</p>
                <p>In case products were initially purchased with gift vouchers, your refund will be paid in the form of
                    a gift voucher. The refund guidelines only apply to products.</p>
                <p>At the moment there are 5 addresses that we collect the returns: the USA, Germany, France, UK &
                    Lithuania. You will be offered one of those in accordance with the distance.</p>
                <p>The Terms & Conditions of our Returns Policy prevail in the case of miscommunication or otherwise.
                </p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: var(--text-black); margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    Cancellation Of The Order</h2>
                <p>The Customer has the right to cancel the order within 12 hours if the order was not shipped prior the
                    cancellation was made.</p>
                <p>The Customer has to keep in mind that all orders are processed as quickly as possible so
                    cancellations are time-sensitive.</p>
                <p>If the Customer wishes to cancel the order and receive a refund the Company can send instructions on
                    how to proceed with that upon the Customer’s request <a href="#contact"
                        style="color: var(--primary-blue); font-weight: 700;">here</a>.</p>
